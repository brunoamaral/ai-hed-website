## **Pilot Courses at FOI, University of Zagreb, Croatia**

The **Faculty of Organization and Informatics (FOI), University of Zagreb / Sveučilište u Zagrebu**, has launched its Pilot Course Units under the *Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning (AI-HED)* project, co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ programme.

As part of this European initiative, FOI’s pilot courses explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be integrated into higher education in a **critical, responsible, and future-oriented** way, preparing students for the digital transformation of business, communication, and innovation.

###  **Pilot Courses at FOI**

At FOI, four Pilot Course Units were selected to represent diverse perspectives on technology, management, and communication in business contexts:

* **Digital Transformation** —  [Martina Tomicic Furjan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martina-tomicic-furjan-8a003b1/), [Ana Kutnjak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-kutnjak-500340218/), [Larisa Hrustek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larisa-hrustek-b93618170/)

* **Business Process Modeling** — [Katarina Tomičić-Pupek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-tomi%C4%8Di%C4%87-pupek-b108862/), [Matija Šajn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matijasajn/)

* **Business Communication** — [Violeta Vidacek-Hains](https://www.linkedin.com/in/violeta-vidacek-hains-810b397b/), [Maja Kućar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maja-ku%C4%87ar-5a0875183/)

* **Digital Marketing** — [Iva Gregurec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iva-gregurec-21b524223/), [Magdalena Kuštelega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalena-ku%C5%A1telega-5331362b7/)


Each of these courses examines how AI tools can **enhance teaching methodologies**, **improve learning experiences**, and **develop students’ digital and analytical competences** essential for the future of work.

### **What Are the Pilot Courses?**

The Pilot Courses are **existing curricular units** redesigned to include AI tools at key learning moments — from **content creation** and **data analysis** to **personalized feedback** and **collaborative learning**.

At FOI, this integration encourages students to explore how AI can transform business processes, communication strategies, and innovation practices, fostering a balance between **technological innovation and human decision-making**.

### **AI-HED Across Europe**

The FOI pilots are part of a collaborative effort involving four European higher education institutions:

* Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Netherlands)

* University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (Austria)

* School of Communication and Media Studies – Polytechnic University of Lisbon (Portugal)

* University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics (Croatia)

In total, **26 Pilot Courses** are being implemented across the consortium, engaging **over 30 lecturers** and **around 800 students**.

At the end of this phase, the project will share **results, best practices, and recommendations** to help other universities responsibly integrate AI into teaching and learning.
