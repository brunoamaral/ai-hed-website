The **School of Communication and Media Studies – Polytechnic University of Lisbon (ESCS-IPL)** has launched its Pilot Course Units under the *Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning (AI-HED)* project, co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ programme.

These pilots represent a key step in **pedagogical innovation**, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into teaching and learning in a **critical, responsible, and future-oriented** way.

### **Pilot Courses at ESCS**

At ESCS, eight Pilot Courses were selected to represent diverse disciplinary areas across Public Relations and Corporate Communication, Journalism, and Audiovisual and Multimedia Studies:

* **Multiplatform Journalism Workshop** — [Vera Moutinho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veramoutinho)

* **Screenwriting for Journalism** — [Fernanda Bonacho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandabonacho)

* **Journalism Project Seminar** — [Fernanda Bonacho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandabonacho)

* **Integrated Communication Laboratory** — [Raquel da Cruz Leal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raquel-leal-escs)

* **Public Relations Theories and Techniques** — [Tatiana Nunes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatiananunesescs) and [João Pedro Ferreira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaopedroferreira)

* **Employee Communication** — [Inês Veiga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inesveiga)

* **Gaming Strategies in Public Relations** — [António de Almeida Azevedo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonioazevedoescs)

* **Project Seminar on Audiovisual and Multimedia** — [Filipe Montargil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fmontargil)

Each of these courses explores how AI can **enhance teaching methodologies**, **foster critical thinking**, and **create new forms of interaction, production, and knowledge sharing**.

### **What Are the Pilot Courses?**

The Pilot Courses are **existing curricular units** that have been redesigned to include AI tools at key moments — from **content creation** and **personalized feedback** to **group collaboration** and **assessment**.

Through this approach, lecturers and students engage in testing the potential of AI while reflecting on its **ethical, creative, and educational implications** within higher education.

 AI-HED Across Europe

In total, **26 Pilot Courses** are being implemented this semester across the AI-HED consortium, involving **over 30 lecturers** and **around 800 students** from:

* Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Netherlands)

* University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (Austria)

* School of Communication and Media Studies – Polytechnic University of Lisbon (Portugal)

* University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics (Croatia)

At the end of this phase, **results, best practices, and recommendations** will be shared through the AI-HED website to support other higher education institutions in the **responsible and meaningful integration of AI** into teaching and learning.
