The **Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS)** has launched its Pilot Courses within the *Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning (AI-HED)* project, co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ programme.

As one of the four European partners, AUAS explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be integrated into higher education in a **critical, responsible, and practice-driven** way — enhancing business education and preparing students for the challenges of the digital economy.

###  **Pilot Courses at AUAS**

At AUAS, six Pilot Courses were selected to represent diverse perspectives within the fields of **marketing, business, and languages**, involving 10 lecturers from the **Faculty of Business and Economics**.

Each course is being piloted by the following teachers:

* **Project: Marketing Consultant** — [Wilco Verdoold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilco/) and [Reineke Reitsma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reineke-reitsma/)

* **Consumer Branding** — [Erik Kostelijk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-kostelijk-242956/) and [Alexandra Benitez Burgos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abut/)

* **French 1 & 2** — [Manon Cornelissen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manon-cornelissen-466a63291/)

* **Spanish 1 & 2** — [Míriam Olid Goñi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriam-olid/)

* **Personal Finance** — [Ikram Ben Allal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikram-b-58143a89/) and [Raúl Casado Linares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulcasadolinares/)

* **Innovate for Impact** — [Antje van Essen-Hermans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antje-van-essen-hermans-6342099/) and [Anoesjka Timmermans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anoesjka-anuschka-timmermans-b6255a2/)

Each of these courses investigates how AI can **support learning innovation**, **enhance decision-making**, and **build digital and ethical competences** among students preparing for careers in international business.

### **What Are the Pilot Courses?**

The Pilot Courses are **existing curricular units** redesigned to integrate AI tools at key points in the teaching and learning process — from **content creation** and **feedback automation** to **market research**, **financial modelling**, and **creative collaboration**.

AUAS lecturers are exploring how AI can **empower students to analyse data, solve problems creatively, and act ethically** in professional contexts where technology plays an increasingly central role.

###  **AI-HED Across Europe**

The AUAS pilots are part of a joint initiative connecting four European higher education institutions:

* **Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences** (Netherlands)

* **University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna** (Austria)

* **School of Communication and Media Studies – Polytechnic University of Lisbon** (Portugal)

* **University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics** (Croatia)

Together, these institutions are delivering **26 Pilot Courses**, engaging **37 lecturers** and **around 800 students** across Europe. The pilots aim to identify **best practices** and **ethical guidelines** for the responsible use of AI in higher education.
