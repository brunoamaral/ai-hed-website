The **University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (UAS BFI Vienna)** has launched its Pilot Courses within the *Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning (AI-HED)* project, co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ programme.

As part of this European initiative, UAS BFI Vienna’s lecturers are exploring how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be embedded into higher education in a **responsible, inclusive, and practice-oriented** way — connecting technology with real-world applications in business, communication, and management studies.

### **Pilot Courses at UAS BFI Vienna**

Eight Pilot Courses have been selected, representing a broad range of disciplines and teaching approaches:

* **Business English I** — [Barbara Ebersberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-ebersberger-20230835b/)

* **Introduction to Political Science** —  [Bernhard Zeilinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernhard-zeilinger-948894125/)

* Public Affairs in the EU: Fields of action and instruments —  [Bernhard Zeilinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernhard-zeilinger-948894125/)

* Project Management Processes & Tools — [Christian Steinreiber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-steinreiber-4385654a/)

* Interactive Media Games (IMG) \- **Project 1** — [Kai Erenli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erenli/), [Chrisopher Kronenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherkronenberg/), and [Maximilian Mayerl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-mayerl-750b58335/) 

* **Scientific Writing** — [Dietmar Paier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dietmar-paier-56b90a125/)

* **Process Management** — [Friedrich Stallinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fritz-stallinger/)

* **Spanish 1** — [María Dolores Dorado Debeza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-dolores-dorado-debeza-947629110/) 

Through these pilot courses, lecturers are testing how AI tools can **support education**, **enhance critical thinking**, and **streamline project-based learning**. The pilots reflect UAS BFI Vienna’s commitment to developing **AI literacy and ethical awareness** among students across diverse study programmes.

### **What Are the Pilot Courses?**

The Pilot Courses are **existing curricular units** that have been redesigned to integrate AI technologies into teaching and learning — from **automated language support** and **feedback tools** to **AI-assisted research** and **project management simulations**.

This initiative enables lecturers to reflect on the **pedagogical and ethical implications** of AI, while helping students gain practical experience in applying AI in academic and professional contexts.

### 

###  **AI-HED Across Europe**

UAS BFI Vienna’s pilots are part of a broader collaboration between four European higher education institutions:

* Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Netherlands)

* University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (Austria)

* School of Communication and Media Studies – Polytechnic University of Lisbon (Portugal)

* University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics (Croatia)

Together, these partners are implementing **26 Pilot Courses**, engaging **over 30 lecturers** and **around 800 students**. The shared goal: to explore how AI can enhance higher education while ensuring **responsible and human-centred innovation**.
