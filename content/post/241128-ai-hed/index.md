The Polytechnic University of Lisbon is one of the five Higher Education Institutions that submitted the application of the project “Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning” (AI-HED) , that has been awarded with 250.000 euros and received 89 points out of 100 by the European Commission.

The [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com) (AUAS) was the applicant organisation, in partnership with the [University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna](https://www.fh-vie.ac.at/en/) (UAS-BFI), the [Polytechnic University of Lisbon (IPL)](https://www.ipl.pt/en) and the [University of Zagreb](https://www.unizg.hr/homepage/) (UNIZG).

The broader aim of AI-HED Project is to adjust the teaching and learning environments at HEIs (Higher Education Institutions) to the shifts caused by Artificial Intelligence (AI). With this project, the consortium wants to explore, test and conceptualise the impact of AI on teaching and learning, enhance teachers skills, competences and attitudes to use AI in teaching and learning, enhance students skills, competences and attitudes to use AI in learning and also develop recommendations for HEIs on integration of AI in teaching and learning.

AI-HED is a two years project, ending in the end of the academic year 2025/2026, and will develop a variety of activities, such as: 

- A set of measures to enhance the AI literacy of lecturers (AI starter kit, training and Massive Open Online Course - MOOC) 
- Design, implementation and evaluation of 16 pilot courses which integrate AI in teaching and learning from different disciplines 
- Development of concluding recommendations on how to integrate AI in teaching and learning 
- A set of outreach activities to share the results with relevant stakeholders 

AI-HED focuses on a key topic of the on-going digital transformation - Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is spreading at an unprecedented pace and has a profound impact on higher education, as exemplified by the emergence of ChatGPT and similar tools. AI-HED explores ways to adjust the teaching and learning environments at higher education institutions (HEIs) to the shifts caused by AI. More specifically, the project aims to test and conceptualise the impact of AI on the teaching and learning 

process, to enhance the skills and competences of teachers and students to use AI in teaching and learning environments, and to develop recommendations for HEIs on integration of AI in the teaching and learning process in a responsible, critical and inclusive way 

Erasmus+ is the EU Programme in the fields of education, training, youth and sport for the 2021-2027 period, and AI-HED Project was submitted and awarded under the Key Action 2: Cooperation among organisations and institutions.  

The Polytechnic University of Lisbon team for AI-HED is Ana Raposo, Bruno Amaral and Tatiana Nunes, all faculty from the Public Relations and Corporate Communication Department from the School of Media Studies and Communication (ESCS-IPL).
