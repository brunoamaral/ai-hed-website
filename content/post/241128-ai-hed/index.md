After many months of working together to prepare the proposal and with the project already in its beginning stages, with various activities already underway and after several online meetings, the team met in person to officially start the project.

The two-day meeting brought together representatives of the four partner organisations. From the **School of Communication and Media Studies - Polytechnic University of Lisbon (ESCS-IPL)**, Ana Raposo, Tatiana Nunes, and Bruno Amaral Tiago attended; representing the **Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS)** were Erik Kostelijk, Bernard Smeenk, and Margit Varga; the **Fachhochschule BFI Wien (UAS-BFI)** was represented by Dietmar Paier, Johannes Wetzinger, and Anastasija Lyubova; and from the **University of Zagreb - Faculty of Organization and Informatics**, Izabela Oletic participated, with Bogdan Okreša Đurić joining online.

Each of the partners gave an update on the status of the activities relating to the Working Package for which they are responsible, additional tasks were defined and details were given of each institution's contribution to each part of the project.

In addition to this progress report, the meeting was also marked by the presentation of two important documents for the project: the ‘Inclusion and Diversity Agenda’ by the Amsterdam team and the ‘Communication Plan’ by the Lisbon team.

**About the AI-HED - Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning**

The AI-HED Project, co-funded by the European Commission, aims to adapt the teaching and learning environments at our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to the shifts caused by Artificial Intelligence (AI). With this project, the consortium will explore, test and conceptualise the impact of AI on teaching and learning, enhance teachers’ skills, competencies and attitudes to use AI in teaching and learning, enhance students skills, competencies and attitudes to use AI in learning and also develop recommendations for HEIs on integration of AI in teaching and learning.

The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) was the applicant organisation, in partnership with the University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (UAS-BFI), the Polytechnic University of Lisbon (IPL) and the University of Zagreb - Faculty of Organization and Informatics (FOI).

The project “Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning” (AI-HED) - 2024-1-NL01-KA220-HED-000248874, launched with co-funding from the European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme in the fields of education, training, youth, and sport for the 2021-2027 period, was submitted and awarded under Key Action 2: Cooperation among organisations and institutions.
