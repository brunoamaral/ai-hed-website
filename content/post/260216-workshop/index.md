On 27 January, during the [AMSIB](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/amsib) Academy Day, teaching staff came together for an AI-HED Workshop on AI in Teaching and Learning. The goal was to explore how artificial intelligence can be meaningfully integrated into higher education, from a practical and pedagogical standpoint.

### From evidence to practice

We presented insights from our primary research with the pre-course survey and a focus group, and our use case on Consumer Branding lectures.

### Reflecting on our own courses

The session included a discussion titled "In what way would you integrate AI into one of your own courses?", where participants reflected on their own teaching contexts. Collaborative exchange of impressions, challenges, recommendations, and peer advice were part of this workshop.

### What stood out

The session created space for open discussion and mutual learning. Colleagues left with a stronger sense of what is possible, what is difficult, and where the real opportunities lie when it comes to AI in education. Both the enthusiasm and the honest concerns shared throughout the workshop made it clear: this is a conversation worth continuing.
