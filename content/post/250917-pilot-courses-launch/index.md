We are pleased to announce the launch of the **AI-HED Pilot Courses**, a key milestone in the Erasmus+ project *Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning (AI-HED)*.

Over the coming academic year, **24 pilot courses** will be delivered at four partner institutions across Europe. These courses explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be meaningfully and responsibly integrated into everyday teaching and learning.

### What Are the Pilot Courses?

The pilot courses are **existing curriculum courses** that have been redesigned to incorporate AI tools into various aspects of the learning experience — from content creation and assessment to collaboration and personalization. The aim is to test the practical value of AI in diverse educational contexts and disciplines.

The pilot courses are not only an opportunity for experimentation but are part of a structured implementation and evaluation process. Each course will be monitored according to a shared implementation protocol to ensure that outcomes can be meaningfully compared and translated into broader recommendations for the higher education sector.

### Key Facts

- **Number of pilot courses**: 24
- **Institutions involved**:
  - *Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), Netherlands*
  - *University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna, Austria*
  - *Polytechnic University of Lisbon, Portugal*
  - *University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Croatia*
- **Lecturers involved**: 32
- **Students participating**: Approximately 800

Each course is tailored to explore a specific aspect of AI in education, such as using AI for feedback, personalizing assignments, or supporting group work. The pilots are supported by training materials, shared frameworks, and a collaborative learning environment across institutions.

### What Comes Next?

As the pilot courses progress, our team will be gathering insights into how AI can support students and lecturers in higher education. These experiences will help us understand what works well, what challenges may arise, and how AI tools can be used responsibly in the classroom.

Over time, we'll be sharing key findings, best practices, and practical tips to help other universities explore the use of AI in teaching and learning. All results will be made available through the [AI-HED website](https://ai-hed.eu), helping to inform the future of higher education across Europe.

### Stay Connected

This announcement is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will share updates, interviews with lecturers and students, and early findings from the pilot courses.
