## 2.1 AI as a tool

A primary purpose of using AI in academic education is for students to
use AI as an aid and as a tool for achieving learning objectives.
Teachers need to decide how to use the affordances of AI as a tool, as
the didactical value of technology is never inherent but must be
thoughtfully developed with the learning outcomes for students in mind.

Therefore, AI is a tool to be utilized; it is not AI that dictates the
practice of teaching and learning, but the teacher who determines its
relevance and functions within their course.

## 2.2 Human-centered course design 

Teachers and students are at the forefront of increasingly
technology-driven learning environments. While AI can enhance and expand
pedagogical possibilities, it cannot replicate the nuanced
understanding, empathy, and mentorship that educators bring to the
learning process. A human-centered approach ensures that teachers remain
integral as learning architects and coaches using AI at best to
cultivate curiosity, promote higher-order thinking, and support the
emotional and social dimensions of learning across diverse educational
scenarios.

Following a human-centered approach in academic teaching means designing
courses in a way that supports the involvement of learners in all stages
of the learning process according to prior knowledge, capabilities, and
needs in relation to defined learning outcomes. In all steps of
designing and developing a course, the needs of learners remain the key
reference of didactic design.

AI offers a wider range of opportunities to tailor courses more
effectively to the interests, strengths, and needs of students.

## 2.3 Accessible, equitable, and inclusive education

However, AI presents both threats and opportunities. To support students
in developing professional, creative, and responsible use of AI as a key
skill of this decade, every pedagogical approach must be grounded in
three principles: accessibility, equity, and inclusion.

### Ensure equal access for students

Accessibility ensures that all learners, including those with
disabilities and other learning challenges, have equal opportunities to
achieve learning outcomes by accessing and engaging with course
materials, activities, and assessments equitably, regardless of
personal, social, or economic circumstances. This also means that
students from lower-income backgrounds must not face disadvantages when
using AI in academic education.

### Take care of diversity and equity

Equity refers to transforming educational practices and using AI to
actively support students from diverse backgrounds, with varying
language skills, prior knowledge, and learning habits. The goal is to
provide equal opportunities for all students to achieve learning
outcomes.

AI tools should facilitate, not hinder, diverse learning needs. Consider
how these tools can be adapted to accommodate various backgrounds,
abilities, and language proficiencies, fostering inclusive learning
experiences that respect different learning habits, backgrounds,
perspectives, and approaches while preventing disadvantages stemming
from personal, cultural, social, or economic circumstances.

### Design inclusive teaching and learning

Inclusion is defined as "an ongoing process aimed at offering quality
education for all while respecting diversity and the different needs and
abilities, characteristics and learning expectations of the students and
communities, eliminating all forms of discrimination" (UNESCO 2009:
126). This definition clarifies that using AI is a necessary step, but
not a sufficient one, and that teachers must actively reframe teaching
and learning practices to create learning environments where all
students can equally develop AI skills.

Therefore, consider students' varying levels of access to technology,
too. Use AI options that promote equal access to AI tools for learning,
assignments, and assessments in your course to avoid disadvantaging
students who may have limited resources.
