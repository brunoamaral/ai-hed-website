These guidelines particularly address teachers who have a strong
interest in exploring the strengths and opportunities of AI in academic
education, while also considering potential risks and avoiding threats.

Although the focus is on generative AI, these guidelines also refer to
topics relevant to other types of AI: Rethinking teaching concepts, the
need for advancing teaching skills, ensuring accessible, equitable, and
inclusive education, legal compliance and ethical responsibility in
using AI for teaching, learning, and research are topics relevant in
every academic area.

These guidelines have three primary aims:

- to increase teachers\' knowledge of the implications of using AI in
    academic education,

- to highlight didactic design options, teaching scenarios, and
    requirements for realizing the positive potential of AI in academic
    teaching while avoiding unintended effects in courses,

- to support the legally compliant and ethically responsible use of AI
    in university teaching.

*Delimitation:*

These guidelines do not provide information and guidance on practical
teaching methods, e.g. which AI tool is best suited for a particular
teaching purpose, advising students on formulating meaningful prompts,
or evaluating AI output.

For detailed information on the practicalities of teaching with AI, the
AI-HED project is developing a comprehensive [AI STARTER
KIT](https://ai-hed.eu/resources/starter-kit/) which provides valuable
information on AI terminology, teaching concepts, a heatmap of AI tools
suited for promoting specific skills, a well-documented list of
recommendable AI tools, and a collection of good practices in teaching
with AI.

## Guidelines Overview

These comprehensive guidelines are organized into six main sections:

### [1. The Impact of AI on Academic Education](./01-impact-of-ai/)
Learn how AI is transforming higher education, why it's a game-changer, and what skills teachers need to develop. This section covers the different types of AI and how to stay current with developments.

### [2. Pedagogical Approaches](./02-pedagogical-approaches/)
Discover human-centered approaches to course design with AI, focusing on accessibility, equity, and inclusion. Learn how to use AI as a tool while keeping students at the center of learning.

### [3. Principles of Course Design](./03-principles-of-course-design/)
Understand how to integrate AI into the constructive alignment approach, cultivate critical thinking, and foster academic integrity in your courses.

### [4. Designing Courses](./04-designing-courses/)
Explore practical didactic scenarios, teaching methods, assessment strategies, and grading approaches when using AI in your courses. Includes comprehensive guidance on evaluation and tool selection.

### [5. Legal Compliance and Ethical Responsibility](./05-legal-compliance/)
Ensure you understand the legal requirements and ethical considerations when using AI in teaching, including data protection, copyright, and responsible use practices.

### [6. Recommended AI Tools](./06-ai-tools/)
Access our curated list of AI tools suitable for teaching and learning, with links to comprehensive resources and references.
