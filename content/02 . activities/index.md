This project aims to enhance the integration of AI-based tools into teaching, learning, and assessment practices across Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Our approach is structured around three interconnected activities, each designed to achieve specific objectives and collectively contribute to the overall project goals.

### STARTER KIT for AI Education{.title}
A curated collection of essential resources for university teachers to effectively use AI-based tools in education.  

1. A glossary of digital literacy terms.  
2. A heatmap visualizing key digital competencies of each AI tool.  
3. A selection of AI-based tools with their applicability and case studies.  
4. A compilation of current practices in our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).  

**WHEN**: Until Spring 2025  

**Expected Results**:  
- A comprehensive **STARTER KIT** that provides educators with the knowledge and tools to integrate AI effectively.  
- Inclusion of case studies, skills descriptions, and a reference guide for digital competencies.

### A 2-Day Training on AI Literacy{.title}
Training designed for HEI educators with varying knowledge levels on AI.  
**HOW**:  
- Combining face-to-face sessions on campus and virtual elements connecting lecturers from all participating HEIs.

- Participants will learn to:  
  - Recognize key digital competences for AI use.  
  - Apply AI in teaching and learning.  
  - Develop AI-integrated assignments and evaluate their effectiveness.  
  - Collaborate to devise AI-use scenarios with peer and moderator feedback.  

**WHEN**: Until Spring 2025  
**WHERE**: On-campus and virtual hybrid sessions
