As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize fields ranging from healthcare and finance to education and the arts, a foundational understanding of its key concepts has never been more essential. 

In higher education, AI plays a crucial role in research and practical applications, shaping the tools we use and how we approach complex problems. 

Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned researcher, this glossary guides the terminology, techniques, and core ideas that define this dynamic field. From the basics of machine learning to the nuances of neural networks and ethical considerations, this glossary is designed to be a starting point in navigating the language of AI. 

Each term serves as a gateway into a specific aspect of AI, illustrating how these concepts interconnect to form the systems and technologies we engage with today. By becoming familiar with this terminology, you’ll gain insight into the structure and processes that make AI a transformative force in academia and beyond. Use this glossary as a resource for study, inspiration, or simply to deepen your understanding of the artificial intelligence landscape. Each term, while simple on its own, contributes to the broader story of AI. This field is about machines and the future of human knowledge, creativity, and discovery. 

Each concept in the glossary is described using three features: a definition, a description, and an example.
