# Objectives

These guidelines particularly address teachers who have a strong
interest in exploring the strengths and opportunities of AI in academic
education, while also considering potential risks and avoiding threats.

Although the focus is on generative AI, these guidelines also refer to
topics relevant to other types of AI: Rethinking teaching concepts, the
need for advancing teaching skills, ensuring accessible, equitable, and
inclusive education, legal compliance and ethical responsibility in
using AI for teaching, learning, and research are topics relevant in
every academic area.

These guidelines have three primary aims:

-   to increase teachers\' knowledge of the implications of using AI in
    academic education,

-   to highlight didactic design options, teaching scenarios, and
    requirements for realizing the positive potential of AI in academic
    teaching while avoiding unintended effects in courses,

-   to support the legally compliant and ethically responsible use of AI
    in university teaching.

*Delimitation:*

These guidelines do not provide information and guidance on practical
teaching methods, e.g. which AI tool is best suited for a particular
teaching purpose, advising students on formulating meaningful prompts,
or evaluating AI output.

For detailed information on the practicalities of teaching with AI, the
AI-HED project is developing a comprehensive [AI STARTER
KIT](https://ai-hed.eu/resources/starter-kit/) which provides valuable
information on AI terminology, teaching concepts, a heatmap of AI tools
suited for promoting specific skills, a well-documented list of
recommendable AI tools, and a collection of good practices in teaching
with AI.
