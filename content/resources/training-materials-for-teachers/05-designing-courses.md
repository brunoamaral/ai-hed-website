# Designing Courses: Didactical Scenarios, Teaching Methods, Assessment & Grading

## AI for Student-centered and Personalized Learning

### Embrace AI as a co-teacher -- and as a learning partner for your students 

Students can use AI as a study tool, tutor, brainstorming partner, and
much more. Teachers must consider how students should interact with AI
tools and AI-driven resources. To this end, teachers need to be aware of
the many ways in which AI can be used and get familiar with the idea
that AI can be made a valuable co-teacher. Here are a few examples of
how teachers can adopt AI as co-teacher.

For instance, teachers should seek using **generative AI** for

-   to create tailor-made learning materials and feedback, e.g. to
    support personalized learning paths, to support students with minor
    prior knowledge closing knowledge gaps, or to support or to motivate
    particularly talented students with extra tasks,

-   to create challenge-based, game-based, and real-world learning
    environments to motivate students to engage more with the contents,

-   or to provide real-time feedback and recommendations based on
    personal learning progress.

Embracing generative AI as a learning partner for students includes
designing and training chatbots and integrating them into courses as
'learning buddies', tutors, feedback providers, and more.

At a more advanced level of AI proficiency, analytical and predictive AI
tools can be deployed deployed to analyse student engagement patterns,
and to predict students-at-risk or student success.

### Think about how to use AI for more personalized and adaptive learning

AI can help tailor learning paths to individual student needs, enabling
personalizing feedback, learning processes, and learning materials. This
allows students to grasp complex topics at their own pace, catering to
different learning speeds and styles. While teachers are often
accustomed to designing interaction with students for a uniform group of
students, AI provides many opportunities to adapt teaching and learning
processes to diverse needs and interests.

### Define the purpose and role of AI in your course

Generative AI can be used for multiple purposes and in many different
ways in courses and, thus, may take very different roles for students.
As a teacher, you should be very clear about both.

AI can take very different roles (see Mollick & Mollick 2023):

-   **Mentor:** Provides frequent, immediate, and adaptive quality
    feedback to support student learning.

-   **Tutor:** Uses questioning techniques, collaborative
    problem-solving, and personalized instruction to guide students.

-   **Coach:** Helps students understand learning processes, identify
    gaps in their knowledge, and develop effective study techniques.

-   **Teammate:** Contributes specific knowledge or skills to a team,
    offers social support, and presents diverse perspectives.

-   **Simulator:** Facilitates skill and knowledge transfer by creating
    contexts of application, AI-based agents, and settings with
    distributed roles.

-   **Tool:** Assists in carrying out developmental, analytical,
    evaluative, design, creative tasks.

## Didactic Scenarios for Teaching with Generative AI

There are numerous didactical scenarios for integrating AI into a
course. Below is a -- highly selective -- list of teaching concepts with
some practical indications that may be useful when preparing a course.

| **Pedagogical Approach** | **Implementation** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Problem-based Learning (PBL)** | PBL is a practice-oriented teaching and learning method in which students work autonomously on authentic problems in small groups in a self-directed manner, while teachers supervise them as tutors. AI can assist in the development of problem-solving skills through: <br> - Search for information about problem structure and manifestations. <br> - Discussing and evaluating problem-solving techniques. <br> - Evaluating pros and cons of problem-solving approaches. <br> - Providing expert knowledge for specific tasks and challenges. |
| **Project-oriented Learning (POL)** | POL fosters collaboration to develop and implement solutions to real-world problems. AI may: <br> - Act as a virtual collaboration partner. <br> - Suggest project team formations based on expertise. <br> - Act as a coach to improve collaboration quality. <br> - Examine the progress and quality of project work. |
| **Constructive Feedback & Coaching** | Constructive feedback reinforces positive learning achievements and reformulates errors as areas for improvement. AI can: <br> - Provide personalized feedback. <br> - Assist students in self-assessment. <br> - Reinforce and motivate students. |
| **Discourse-oriented Learning** | Acquisition of knowledge can be achieved through formal or informal exchange of perspectives. AI can: <br> - Use chatbots to represent different perspectives in discussions. <br> - Act as a Socratic dialogue partner. <br> - Let students test their opinions against a virtual sparring partner. |
| **Linking Theory and Practical Application** | Integrating theory with practice enhances understanding. AI can: <br> - Visualize linkages between theoretical concepts and practical challenges. <br> - Explore AI's applicability in real-world settings. |
| **Self-directed Learning** | AI helps learners by: <br> - Identifying learning needs. <br> - Organizing individual learning paths. <br> - Searching and evaluating learning resources. <br> - Documenting and reflecting on progress. |
| **Game-based Learning (GBL)** | AI can take roles in game-based learning as: <br> - Game co-developer. <br> - Game character. <br> - Teammate. <br> - Consultant for game strategy. <br> - Referee. |
| **Critical Thinking** | AI requires critical evaluation due to potential inaccuracies. AI can: <br> - Encourage students to verify factual accuracy. <br> - Support reflections on AI-generated outputs. <br> - Foster awareness of AI's influence on perceptions and work processes. |

## Anticipating Potential Implications of AI for Your Course

### Reflect on the impact of AI on course-related time management

Whichever teaching scenario you choose, using AI in the teaching setting
often requires more time than expected: Teachers must allocate time for
explaining the purpose and roles of AI, the rules of usage, assessment
criteria, and providing instructions on smart prompting, prompt
evaluation, as well as fostering critical reflection and evaluation of
AI outputs. As we know from previous experience, the time required to
clarify AI-related questions with students is often underestimated.

These activities cannot be done casually, and more time instructing
students on using AI and evaluating outputs should be scheduled when
designing a course. As the number of teaching units usually remains
unchanged and working with AI is an add-on, teachers may need to adjust
the course timeline to ensure sufficient time for AI-related activities.

### Anticipate changes in learning behaviour triggered by AI

AI may affect learner behaviour in many ways. When assessing the
potential implications, consider how AI can positively impact student
learning and how to mitigate possible drawbacks. To better anticipate
changes, it often helps to complete assignments that require AI use
yourself or discuss this task with colleagues to identify potential
challenges and improvements, too.

### Rethink the quality of learning outcomes

If students are encouraged or required to use AI for assignments and
examinations, teachers should establish criteria to assess the results
when part of them is AI-generated. Two options are particularly
relevant: First, define assessment criteria for correct, responsible,
and successful use of AI itself; and second, define assessment criteria
for independent parts of students' work, e.g. critical reflection of the
quality of outputs and using outputs for other tasks.

## Teaching Strategies to Promote Critical Thinking {#teaching-strategies-to-promote-critical-thinking}

### Always link the use of AI with critical thinking:

AI can do parts of the work we have done ourselves before. Generative AI
in particular often produces false or misleading output. Therefore,
students need to learn how to evaluate this output critically. This can
be done with or without the help of AI.

Students may be assigned

-   to evaluate outputs regarding factual accuracy, consistency, and
    academic integrity in the classroom without the help of digital
    media

-   to reason and reflect on the relevance and impact of AI-generated
    outputs for particular groups in terms of diversity, inclusion, and
    sustainability

-   to reflect on the risks that arise when AI-generated outputs are
    adopted without critical assessment

-   to reflect on the ways the use of AI is shaping our results, how we
    perceive reality, and the way we work and collaborate with others

To develop students' ability of critical thinking, some teaching methods
have proven to be particularly helpful and effective. One common element
of these methods is to test the output against other sources of
information and knowledge.

| **Method**  | **Approach**  | **Implementation**  |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Observe-Question-Compare (OQC)** | Analyzing an AI output by examining its details and comparing its information with an authoritative source | **Observe:** Identify and examine the features of the AI output, even if they feel self-evident. For instance, ask: "How many different aspects are addressed in the output?" <br><br> **Question:** Critically evaluate every aspect of the output by asking questions such as: Is the AI-generated information true and accurate? Is it relevant? Is it fair? <br><br> **Compare:** Let students compare AI output with other credible sources of information, e.g., textbooks, journal articles, descriptions of good practices, professional association information, or market research data. |
| **Review-Evaluate-Reprompt (RER)** | Defining the quality standards for a specific task and evaluating AI outputs based on those criteria. | **Review Criteria:** Define (also in collaboration with your students) what constitutes a quality, desirable, or "good" output. This could include specificity, context, organization, clarity, usability, format, limitations, and other factors. <br><br> **Evaluate:** What are the gaps between the defined criteria and the AI-generated output? What has the AI added, deleted, or modified? What advice does it offer for improvement, based on the feedback it provides? What might AI not be able to improve, given its inherent limitations? <br><br> **Refine the Prompt:** Use the identified criteria to craft more detailed or specific instructions for the AI. Regenerate the output with a refined prompt, or decide to stop prompting and make the necessary changes manually. |
| **Ideas-Connections-Extensions (ICE)** | Generating ideas, making connections between them, and extending them into new applications. | **Ideas:** Generate initial ideas on the questions to be answered or problems to be solved using AI. For example, what potential solutions could help reduce plastic waste in the community? <br><br> **Connections:** Identify and explore connections between these ideas and the insights gained from AI. For example, how can these solutions be integrated with existing recycling programs or community initiatives? <br><br> **Extensions:** Extend these ideas into broader applications using AI for further research. For example, how can these solutions be scaled up or adapted for other environmental issues? |

minor adaptations)

## Using AI for Feedback to Students

Imagine a co-teacher who is available to students for feedback 24/7.
Teachers may use AI as a co-teacher that provides real-time feedback on
assignments, quizzes, and essays, allowing students to identify areas
for improvement immediately, without waiting for personalized feedback.
This instant feedback loop promotes continuous improvement and
engagement.

AI can be used to design assignments, develop examination methods, and
refine assessment criteria.

AI could also assist teachers in grading multiple-choice exams,
providing rubric-based feedback on essays, and assessing assignments,
and other tasks. By streamlining these processes, AI can save
instructors significant time, enabling them to focus more on improving
assessment quality and giving effective feedback.

Furthermore, AI-driven adaptive assessments can adjust the difficulty
level of tasks and assessments based on students' responses. This
approach offers a personalized evaluation experience and provides a more
accurate picture of students' knowledge, skills, and competencies.

However, despite its advantages, there are serious limitations to using
AI for assessment and grading.

## Revising Methods of Assessment and Grading

### Caveat: Follow the provisions of the EU AI Act

In the European Union, the AI Act plays a critical role in regulating
the use of AI in teaching, particularly for testing and assessment
purposes.

The AI Act explicitly identifies high-risk systems in the education
sector (European Commission, 2024). These include AI applications
related to admissions, performance assessment, educational standards
evaluation, and monitoring during examinations. Performance assessment
also encompasses systems designed to control the learning process.

AI applications explicitly intended for assessing examination papers are
deemed particularly critical. Even the use of general-purpose AI for
examination assessments is subject to stringent risk management
requirements, including transparency, thorough documentation, and human
oversight.

As a result, using AI for high-stakes decisions, such as course
admissions or automated examination assessments, is discouraged for
practical and ethical reasons. Universities must carefully evaluate
whether deploying high-risk AI applications aligns with their
responsibilities and regulatory obligations.

### Revise your assessment methods and criteria

If AI is included as a means of learning and working on assignments and
assessments, existing assessments are highly likely in need of
improvement.

When revising your assessments, develop a clear system for criteria that
ensures careful

-   distinction between different skill levels of AI usage according to
    your learning outcomes,

-   identification of different quality levels of practical work with
    AI,

-   identification of different compliance levels with standards and
    criteria of academic integrity and good scientific practice.

When students must use AI for examinations (written or oral), think
about

-   how your examination questions and examination tasks must be
    designed to capture independent knowledge, skills, and competencies,

-   how students must document AI- and non-AI parts of assessments and
    how to explain this to students,

-   and how AI could assist you in correction and grading in a legally
    compliant way.

### Strengthen competency-based assessment 

Teachers realize that AI enables and requires assessments focused on
skill mastery rather than memorization, tracking students' competencies
and skills in real-time. This shift encourages students to demonstrate
understanding through the application and elaboration of personal
approaches and results, rather than relying solely on traditional
testing.

Hence, teachers need to develop further assessment methods that meet
three main objectives:

-   First, to prevent students from passing off AI-generated work as
    their own. This requires cross-referencing documentation and
    ensuring transparency.

<!-- -->

-   Second, design assignments and examinations in such a way that the
    use of AI is documented in a way that it is possible to distinguish
    between AI-generated and independent performance parts.

-   Third, to develop examination methods that require students to
    practically demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have acquired,
    as well as to explain the solutions they have developed components.

Teachers are also increasing the oral or performative components of
examinations in order to make individual learning progress and
performance more visible. Here, it is very helpful to ask students to
explain in more detail how they arrived at their results and to justify
the choices they made.

Teachers should bear in mind, however, that increased oral examinations
also lead to more time being spent on examinations.

Ultimately, it is clear that teachers need to refine three key elements
of assessments when using AI in courses:

-   examination methods

-   assessment criteria

-   the required documentation;

and ask for information on

-   their tool-related experiences,

-   the perceived impact of AI on their learning activities and
    assessments,

-   and on the students' ability to distinguish between self-generated
    and AI-generated results,

It is often useful to combine standardized and non-standardized methods
and to ask relevant questions at the end of a teaching unit where AI was
used, while reflection of specific topics may require a longer time of
user experience and a greater variety of experiences.

## Selecting Appropriate AI Tools 

### Apply distinct criteria for the selection of AI tools

Some AI tools may be more suitable for your course than others due to
technical reasons.

In addition, teachers have to select appropriate AI tools for
educational purposes by applying legal, didactic, social and ethical
criteria, such as:

-   Compliance with data protection regulations

-   Alignment of the AI tool with learning objectives

-   Equal accessibility for all students: Every student must be able to
    use the permitted or prescribed AI application under the same
    conditions.

-   Documentability of AI outputs

-   Potential of the AI tool to foster creativity in teaching and
    learning

### Define which tools can or must be used:

Often it is advantageous to specify which AI tools students must use,
rather than allowing them to decide themselves. Teachers should decide:

-   Which AI applications are permitted or prohibited for a certain task
    or assignment

-   Whether specific AI applications are mandatory

-   How students must document their use of AI, including purpose, form,
    and extent.
