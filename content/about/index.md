## AI-HED - Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning

The AI-HED Project, co-funded by the European Commission, aims to adapt the teaching and learning environments at our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to the shifts caused by Artificial Intelligence (AI). With this project, the consortium will explore, test and conceptualise the impact of AI on teaching and learning, enhance teachers skills, competences and attitudes to use AI in teaching and learning, enhance students skills, competences and attitudes to use AI in learning and also develop recommendations for HEIs on integration of AI in teaching and learning.

AI-HED is a two years project, ending in August 2026, and will develop a variety of activities, such as:

- A set of measures to enhance the AI literacy of lecturers (AI starter kit, training and Massive Open Online Course - MOOC)
- Design, implementation and evaluation of 16 pilot courses which integrate AI in teaching and learning from different disciplines
- Development of concluding recommendations on how to integrate AI in teaching and learning
- A set of outreach activities to share the results with relevant stakeholders

This project focuses on a key topic of the on-going digital transformation - Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is spreading at an unprecedented pace and has a profound impact on higher education, as exemplified by the emergence of ChatGPT and similar tools. AI-HED explores ways to adjust the teaching and learning environments at higher education institutions (HEIs) to the shifts caused by AI. More specifically, the project aims to test and conceptualise the impact of AI on teaching and learning processes, to enhance the skills and competences of teachers and students to use AI, and to develop recommendations for HEIs on integration of AI in the teaching and learning process in a responsible, critical and inclusive way.

The Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) was the applicant organisation, in partnership with the University of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna (UAS-BFI), the Polytechnic University of Lisbon (IPL) and the University of Zagreb (UNIZG).

The project “Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education Teaching and Learning” (AI-HED) - 2024-1-NL01-KA220-HED-000248874, launched with co-funding from the European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme in the fields of education, training, youth, and sport for the 2021-2027 period, was submitted and awarded under Key Action 2: Cooperation among organisations and institutions.
